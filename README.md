> **NOTE**: This has no relations with the original ProtonUp project, and I thankful for the original author.
>
> I've create it because the original project had a few issues with its Python dependencies (that most likely got fixed already).
> I wanted to to re-create it in rust, in a way it could be used as a lib and a CLI.

Adding new tools should be a simple process, check the docs section below!

## Usage

The default way is to simply invoke the cli, and navigate the text interface.

```bash
protonup-rs
```

To run a quick update and get the latest GE Proton version without navigating the TUI, you can use the quick flag:

```bash
Usage: protonup-rs [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -q, --quick-download  Skip Menu, auto detect apps and download using default parameters
  -h, --help            Print help
```

## Installing

### Clickable download (Steam Deck Friendly)

- download .desktop file
- run it
- open a new terminal window to run `protonup-rs`

<h3 align="center">
  <a name="download button" href="https://github.com/auyer/protonup-rs/releases/latest/download/protonup-rs-install.desktop">Click Here to Download installer</a>
</h3>

> **NOTE**: This will download a simple ".desktop" file that will download the pre-compiled binary from release, decompress it, place it in "$HOME/.local/bin/", and add this folder to your PATH.

### In one line

Does the same as the installer above, but from the command line

```bash
sh -c 'if curl -S -s -L -O --output-dir /tmp/ --connect-timeout 60 https://github.com/auyer/Protonup-rs/releases/latest/download/protonup-rs-linux-amd64.tar.gz ; then tar -xvzf /tmp/protonup-rs-linux-amd64.tar.gz -C /tmp/ && mv /tmp/protonup-rs ${HOME}/.local/bin/ && [[ "$SHELL" == *"bash"* ]] && [ "$SHELL" = "/bin/bash" ] && echo "export PATH=\"$PATH:${HOME}/.local/bin\"" >> ${HOME}/.bashrc || ([ "$SHELL" = "/bin/zsh" ] && echo "export PATH=\"$PATH:${HOME}/.local/bin\"" >> ${HOME}/.zshrc ) && rm /tmp/protonup-rs-linux-amd64.tar.gz; else echo "Something went wrong, please report this if it is a bug"; read; fi'
```

This assumes `/usr/bin` is in your path. You may change this to any other location (in your path `echo $PATH`).

### Or manually

Get the latest binary:
[Download link](https://github.com/auyer/Protonup-rs/releases/latest/download/protonup-rs-linux-amd64.zip)

It is a single binary. You can just run it, or add it to your path so you can call it from anywhere.

Quick way to add it to your path:
or download the zip from the releases page

```
cd Downloads
sudo unzip protonup-rs-linux-amd64.zip -d /usr/bin
```

## Building from source

You can install from source using the last released version in Crates.io:

```
cargo install protonup-rs
```

Or clone repo:

```bash
cd protonup-rs
cargo build -p protonup-rs --release
mv ./target/release/protonup-rs "your path"
```

## Docs

Code docs available in the [docs/docs.md](./docs/docs.md) file, and default generated docs in [docs.rs/libprotonup](https://docs.rs/libprotonup/latest/libprotonup/).

### Roadmap

1. GUI:
  Not ready for usage. I made a few experiments with different libs, and decided to use the iced/cosmic framework.
  I left the [base structure](https://github.com/auyer/Protonup-rs/tree/feature/gui), and hope to get to it someday or to receive contributions.
